# Concurrent Traffic Simulation

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/> 

Project prompt:

> Throughout the Concurrency course, you have been developing a traffic simulation in which vehicles are moving along streets and are crossing intersections. However, with increasing traffic in the city, traffic lights are needed for road safety. Each intersection will therefore be equipped with a traffic light. In this project, you will build a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections to complete the simulation. Use your knowledge of concurrent programming (such as mutexes, locks and message queues) to implement the traffic lights and integrate them properly in the code base.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
